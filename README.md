# Earthworm
## About
Earthworm is a utility designed to analyze syntactically-valid Python scripts and offer suggestions for improving the program\'s functional decomposition. Earthworm identifies code fragments that serve a separate (algorithmic) purpose from their enclosing function(s), and attempts to create an entirely new function from them. The end result is a Python script where each function does exactly one task.
